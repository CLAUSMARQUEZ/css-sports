          <img class="fc-barcelona" src="FCB.png" alt="barsa">
          <h3>FC Barcelona</h3>
          <p>FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English, German and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions.
          I met this club when i lived in The Netherlands way back in 85, wasn't full fledge until the 90's and 2000's then there was MESSI, he's gone now but i'm still Blaugrana tho.</p>

          <img class="ac-milan" src="ACMilan.png" alt="milan">
          <h3>AC Milan</h3>
          <p>AC Milan was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriates Alfred Edwards and Herbert Kilpin.<br>In honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city's name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano, which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime.
          Even though times have been tough since the 90's, i'm still a bit rossoneri.</p>

          <div class="skill-row">
            <img class="PSG" src="PSG.png" alt="psg">
            <h3>Paris Saint-Germain</h3>
            <p>PSG were founded in 1970, following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. The club was split into two in 1972, with PSG being relegated to Division 3, before returning to Division 1 in 1974. The Parisians won their first major honour, the French Cup, in 1982 and their first Division 1 title in 1986.
            I've seen them off and on since Ronaldinho played there, then other brazilian players have passed thru such as Neymar Jr., now the GOAT is there and i'm rooting for them but granted it's been hard.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="skill-row">
            <img class="R-Madrid" src="RM.png" alt="realmadrid">
            <h3>Real Madrid</h3>
            <p>Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem.
            My merengue fase was due to individual players that were part of the team and style of gameplay still practiced today, a no holds bar approach that just over powers other teams.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="endtro">You might ask yourself, why FCB and RM? well there was a time in the early 90's when i supported both because<br> i liked they're style of game, RM had several players i liked and so did FCB and i thought if those players<br> were on a single team it would be awesome, well maybe not, now we know too many stars on a team doesn't work<br>it would've been nice to see, but i had to make a decision and FCB made it easier for me.</p>
